## Rules of the Game

### Object of the Game

Each player skillfully maneuvers their playing pieces along the paths of the board to capture the opponent's Commander or all their Lances, Probes, and Shields. Pieces move only along paths that align with their directional indicators, creating a dynamic balance of strategy and timing.

The first player to achieve the objective wins!

### Number of Players

- **2 Players:** Each player uses a full set of pieces (Coral and Green).
- **4 Players:** Players can compete individually or in partnerships (Yellow, Blue, Coral, Green).

---

### Playing Pieces

Each piece has direction indicators radiating from its center and must align with the board paths to move.

**Piece Composition:**

- **Commander:** 1
- **Lances:** 2 (4 for Coral/Green in 2-player mode)
- **Probes:** 3 (5 for Coral/Green in 2-player mode)
- **Shields:** 3 (4 for Coral/Green in 2-player mode)

### Gameplay Overview

1. **Setup:** Place pieces as per the game rules. Coral and Green sets are used for 2-player games.
2. **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately. The first turn is taken by Green.
3. **Moves:**
   - **Motion Move:** Move a piece across unoccupied spaces in the direction of one of its indicators. Move ranges are:
     - **Commander:** 1 space
     - **Lances:** 1–3 spaces
     - **Probes:** 1–2 spaces
     - **Shields:** 1 space
   - **Direction Move:** Rotate a piece to change its indicators' direction.
   - **Special Rule for Shields:** Shields can make a direction move after a motion move in the same turn.
4. **Capture:** A piece moves into a space occupied by an opponent's piece to capture it.
5. **End of Game:** The game ends when:
   - A player captures their opponent's Commander.
   - A player captures all their opponent's Lances, Probes, and Shields.
